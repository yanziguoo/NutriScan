# NutriScan 
> An iOS app that tracks daily nutritional intake through computer vision.

*Built with Python and Swift, integrating Google Cloud's VisionAI and Firebase.*

Users take a photo of their food and NutriScan automatically detects and displays the nutrition facts of the foods in the image. The user's nutrional intake is tracked daily and can see if they are meeting their healthy targets, where the user's performance is evaluated throughout the month.
